This is my mini Java project - 1

# JavaSortingAlgorithm-1
Simple Sorting algorithm code based on all the popular sorting techniques.

The project is inspired by the Sorting algorithm visualiser, the same is under process(still under process of learning how to build the web apps).

It will also be ready within next 1-2 months.

Until that please see this one.
